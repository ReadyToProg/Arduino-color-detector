# Arduino-color-detector
An arduino-based color detecting device with photoresistor and RGB LED


This repository contains arduino sketch and .exe file that shows the color on your Windows device.
Exe programm is a little buggy, so I suggest to make your own, according to your needs, that one was made only in demonstration purposes.


After uploding sketch you need to calibrate the device. It is made by typing 1 to the serial port, then putting detector on the whitest thing you ccould find, after that write 2 and put on the darkest one, that is it. The device is ready to show the color. Cool feature is that if the devise will find objects that are whiter or blacker than calibrated parameters it will automaticly recalibrate.
