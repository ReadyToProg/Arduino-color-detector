# Arduino-color-detector
An arduino-based color detecting device with photoresistor and RGB LED


This repository contains arduino sketch and .exe file that shows the color on your Windows device.
Exe programm is a little buggy, so I suggest to make your own, according to your needs, that one was made only in demonstration purposes.
